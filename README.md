# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS
# Stack folder contains C code for stack data structure using different methods like
1. Stack implementation without functions
2. Stack implementation with function (function call by value --CBV)
3. Stack implementation with function (function call by reference --CBR)
4. Stack implementation with structures
5. Stack implementation with structures and function (function call by value)
6. Stack implementation with structures and function (function call by reference)
7. Stack implementation with structures and pointers
8. Stack implementation with structures and pointers using functions and lastly 
9. Application of stack --postfix conversion
# Queue folder contains C code for queue data structure using different methods like
1. Queue implementation without functions
2. Queue implementation with function (function call by value --CBV)
3. Queue implementation with function (function call by reference --CBR)
4. Queue implementation with structures
5. Queue implementation with structures and function (function call by value)
6. Queue implementation with structures and function (function call by reference)
7. Queue implementation with structures and pointers
8. Queue implementation with structures and pointers using functions and lastly 
# Linked list folder contains C code for linked list data structure like 
1. Singly linked list implementation 
2. Doubly linked list implementation 
3. Circular singly linked list implementation 
4. Circular doubly linked list implementation 
5. Stack implementation using linked list
6. Queue implementation using linked list

**Each linked list program contains functions like Insertion, Deletion, Inserting at head, Deleting given element node, Displaying, Reversing the list, Sorting the elements and Swapping given two nodes.**

# Trees folder contains C code for trees data structure like 
1. Tree implementation 
2. Binary search tree implementation 
3. Tree traversals 

**Each tree program has functions like Insertion, Deleting given element node, Searching for an element, Counting number of nodes and Printing. Tree traversal code contains Pre-Order, In-Order and Post-Order traversals.**

# Sortting folder contains C code for sorting algorithms like 
1. Bubble sort  
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort
6. Min heap sort and
7. Max heap sort
# Graphs folder contains C code for searching algorithms like 
1. Breadth first search 
2. Depth first search
